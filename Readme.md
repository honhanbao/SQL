This is where I place some of my work on SQL projects. 

1. SQL_Danny Case Study.
   In this project, I solve SQL challenge from https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/
   
2. European Soccer database
   In this project from kaggle, I use pandas to run sql query and also using pandas datafame to query data of interest for analysis.
   This is a combination work on SQL query and similar function from pandas.
   
   More projects to come!
